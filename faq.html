								<a class="accordion">How safe is flying trapeze?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Flying trapeze is very safe. We use state-ofâ€“the-art equipment and procedures to assure the safety of our students from the time they walk on the site. Students are continually trained on the protection of their health as well as the health of their fellow students.
										<br><br>
									All our equipment is designed to be well above the required safety standards and is kept in excellent shape by constant inspecting and maintenance. We use a fully rated spotting system and safe comfortable belts to protect you when you fly. Our soft, stretchy net assures a nice landing.
									<br><br>
									Keep in mind that scrapes, sore muscles, and blisters are a part of any sport and are no less a part of ours. We work closely with local care services to ensure efficient action should a serious emergency arise.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">Who can participate in classes?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Our classes are designed to meet the needs of a wide range of people. Whether you are athletic or not, afraid or not, ready or not, we are committed to creating a fun and safe environment.
										<br><br>
									- Ages 6 and up are welcome.
										<br><br>
									Students with certain health conditions, or existing or previous injuries may be discouraged from or denied participation if management feels the risk of injury is too great.
										<br><br>
									Women who are pregnant should not participate in any of our physical activities, including flying trapeze, aerials, acrobatics, and trampoline.
										<br><br>
									Anyone under the influence of drugs or alcohol will not be allowed to participate. Our Staff is empowered to deny access to our facility for anyone who they believe may be a danger to themselves or others. Additionally, if a person is rude or uncooperative they may be denied entrance or asked to leave.
									</p>
								</div><br>	

								<a class="accordion">Is there a weight limit for flying trapeze?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Actually it is more complicated than that, so be sure to examine all three factors: WEIGHT, BODY SHAPE and GRIP.  We are committed to working with people of all abilities, shapes and sizes to experience the transformative power of flying trapeze and aerial arts.  If flying trapeze isn't the right place for you to start, our staff will be happy to suggest other options to help you achieve your goals.
										<br><br>
										1. WEIGHT.  205lbs is what we call the weight hesitation.  If you weigh more than that, then we have increasing concerns about safety.  The higher above the 205 lb weight hesitation, the more important the other factors become.
										<br><br>
										2. BODY SHAPE.  The distribution of your weight is important, regardless of how much you weigh.  If you are heavy around your middle, and your waist is wider than your chest, then our safety belt might ride up and cannot effectively protect you.
										<br><br>
										3. GRIP.  Another consideration is whether your hands can support your full body weight.  If you cannot hang from a bar with your feet completely off the ground for at least 30 seconds, then you should not participate at this time.
										<br><br>
									Please contact us if you have concerns. We would love to work with you to identify other classes such as conditioning, acrobatics, silks or trampoline that can serve as a starting point towards the goal of flying trapeze.  If we feel it would be unsafe for either you or our instructors due to your weight, body shape or physical fitness considerations, TSNY reserves the right to deny participation.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">How old do I have to be to participate?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>There is no specific minimum age to participate. Children who are at least 6 years old generally have the required coordination and awareness, but may not have the attention span to last through a 2-hour session.
										<br><br>
										Please give us a call if you are unsure about signing up a child for class. Once a spot is reserved, you are responsible for the full payment even if the child is unwilling or unable to complete the session.
										<br><br>
										A parent or guardian must be present when their children under age 12 are in class, unless they are enrolled in a camp program or special arrangements have been made with the school. All of the child's information must be up-to-date, and we must have a waiver signed by a parent or court-appointed legal guardian for any student under the age of 18.  Relatives, friends and nannies cannot sign the waiver unless they have been designated by a court as the legal guardian for that child.
										<br><br>
										While children are always able to sign up for any all-levels classes offered at our school, we also have specialized programs for youth 6 and up or as specified in the program description.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">How many students do you have in a class?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Class size is dependent on apparatus, class length, and level. Our standard flying trapeze class is 2 hours with a limit of ten students per class. Express classes are offered with fewer students and shorter time frame. Introductory classes may be offered with greater class size. Private groups may request that more people participate, but must understand that unless they wish to purchase extended class time, their group members will have proportionally less turns at flying with each additional student they bring.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">Which classes are appropriate for beginners?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Beginners are welcome to join any class with either NO level distinction, "All Levels", or "Introductory" in the class title. The nature of flying trapeze and aerial arts allows for one student to be on the equipment at a time, so it is not necessary for everyone in class to be working on the same skill. Classes start with a safety lesson for all first time students, and shortly after that you can expect to be on the apparatus. We strive to create a class environment that is effective and fun for everyone. Yes, beginners will fly on the trapeze in their first class!
										<br><br>
										"All Level" Flying Trapeze classes are conducive for participants with skills ranging from beginner through advanced. "Introductory" Flying Trapeze classes have up to 12 students and are great for first time flyers, and students that do not come on a regular basis or are just starting their flying journey. Classes with "Level 2" or greater in the title are reserved for students who have achieved the corresponding skills in their TSNY logbook. Sometimes, there are not enough students to fill a class. Rather than cancel a class we might choose to open it to all levels.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">What is the TSNY logbook?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>The TSNY Logbook is a guide to our curriculum, and a place for you to track your progress as you advance as a flyer. The overall goal of the TSNY Flying Trapeze Curriculum is to teach you to become a safe and competent flyer. Our aim is to build a strong foundation of skills in the early stages of your journey. This will set you up for success with the tricks and skills you'll learn down the road. The information in the logbook is not meant to replace actual instruction, it is purposefully general as your instructors will tailor a progression that works best for you, as an individual.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">What should I wear to flying trapeze class?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Although the net is soft to land in, it can be a little rough on exposed knees, shoulders, and toes. You'll be wearing a safety belt over your shirt and you'll be hooking your knees over the bar, so it's best to wear clothes that fit snugly so they don't get in your way. Tights, yoga pants, or snug sweat pants work well, and shirts with sleeves (even very short ones) are a good idea. Bring a pair of socks to wear while you're flying, and sandals or flip flops to wear between turns. On hot days, you should also bring a towel. If you have long hair, put it up with an elastic band (not plastic hair clips).
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">What is a waiver and why do I have to sign it?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>The waiver is a document designed to protect you and the school. It is designed to inform you of the risk you are taking and to make sure that you (or your parent or court-appointed legal guardian) take full responsibility for that risk. The waiver also allows our insurance to be effective for any situation that warrants its use. It is important to read the waiver carefully and to fully understand it before you sign.
										<br><br>
										You (or your parent or court-appointed legal guardian) will be asked to read and sign a waiver at your first class. Please come 15 minutes early to do this. Copies of the waiver will be available at the start of class, but you may view it or print extra copies beforehand using the link below.
										<br><br>
										The minimum recommended age for participation in all of our classes is 6 years old.
										<br><br>
										STUDENTS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 must have a waiver signed by their parent or court-appointed legal guardian before they will be allowed to participate in the class. Relatives, friends, and nannies cannot sign unless they have been designated by a court as the legal guardian for that child. If you have any questions please give us a call. GROUPS: If you are signing up a group of children, bring signed waivers for each child with you to class.
										<br><br>
										Signing the waiver is separate from registering for a class, and does not mean you are enrolled. You are registered for class once you have paid and received your confirmation email.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">How does the cancellation policy work?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Our classes, programs, events, etc. have specific policies regarding cancellation. Please see our Cancellation Policy page for details.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">How do I reschedule my upcoming class?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Assuming that we've received your cancellation notice within the timeframe specified in our Cancellation Policy, then most reservations can be rescheduled. To reschedule, send an email to our office with the following information:
										<br><br>
										- Name on the reservation
										<br><br>
										- Date and time of original reservation that you are cancelling
										<br><br>
										- Date and time of the class you would like to reschedule to
										<br><br>
										If there is a price differential, then there will either be a credit or additional charge.
										<br><br>
										Most of our group drop in classes require a minimum of 3 days (72 hours) notice for cancellation and rescheduling in which case you must notify us of your desire to reschedule prior to 3 days (72 hours) before your original reservation. Please note, we cannot keep an open credit from a credit card charge on your account so you MUST provide a date in order to reschedule your original reservation.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">Why do I have to fill out a registration form on your site?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>We want to know as much as we can about you, so that we can help you learn and keep you safe. When you come to the school, we keep a copy of your form on site.
										<br><br>
										This way you know that we know about any special needs you might have, how to reach you, and how to reach others who can be there if you need them. If you are a returning student, you will have a chance to review and update your information as needed each time you register for class.
										<br><br>
										It is very important that you keep us up-to-date about your health and contact information. Please remember to let us know when something changes. Each time you sign up for a class, you will be able to review your information and submit any changes.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">Can I get a discount if I buy multiple classes?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Yes! TSNY Los Angeles class card packages provide a way for students to receive discounts on class prices. Click here for more information and to buy a card.
										<br><br>
										A single class card may be shared and used to pay for up to 2 others, for a maximum of 3 people in the same class. Class cards may not be used by a group booking an entire class.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">How many people do we need to book a private class and what does it cost?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>You can book a regularly scheduled class with as many or as few people as you wish. You will be required to cover at minimum the cost of a full class for up to 10 people. If your group has more than 10 people and you book a regularly scheduled two-hour class, please be aware that the more people you have, the less flying per person is possible. Click here for information about our Parties and Events.
									</p>
								</div><br>

								<a class="accordion">Does TSNY have a newsletter?</a>
								<div class="panel">
									<p>Yes! The TSNY newsletter is a great way to stay up to date with all the latest school happenings and announcements! If you have a registered student profile and would like to adjust your newsletter settings (not receiving the newsletter or not receiving the correct locations' newsletter), email the office at LAinfo@trapezeschool.com.
